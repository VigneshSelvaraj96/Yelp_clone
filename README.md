# Yelp_clone
Web Technologies Assignment of implementing server client yelp clone


This is an assignmnet from CSCI 571 Web technologies where we were tasked with replicated yelp api with front end and back end. The front end client will take user
inputs and parse them in a form to send keywords about location(auto detect included) , distance , keywords and categories. Server running in the back will call the yelp
fusion api which will send back data requested in JSON. Client parses the JSON and builds a table of the results. They can be sorted according to their headings
and clicked on to display more information in a card format.


Test was done locally and then tried on GCP.
